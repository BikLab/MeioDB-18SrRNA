# MeioDB-18SrRNA

This repository contains 18S rRNA sequences from the SILVA 138 release, nematode 18S rRNA published in GenBank, and some additional nematode 18S rRNA sequences produced in our lab. Taxonomic ranks for nematodes were fixed accoding to WoRMS database. Files include QIIME2 format (i.e., qza files) and orginal text files for sequences (.fna) and taxonomy (.tsv). Large files were zipped to reduce their size.
